important info about the script before running: 
the script is currently hard coded for Debian 12, you will need to go in and change the download path for debain 12 in the source code. This script has ONLY been tested for debian 12 so be aware.
in order to make the Microsoft defender portion of the script work you will need to go into // https://security.microsoft.com/securitysettings/endpoints/onboarding?tid=1e8ef192-47fe-447d-b76b-6b9e90541078  // and grab the python script generated by the microsft under the perameters "Linux Server" and "Standard"
once you grab that python script you are going to make a file in your linux VM name "atp.py" in the same directory that you set-up the LinuxUserSetupV2 script itself (in the /otp folder)
Of course you'll need to follow standard linux permission stuff by allowing the LinuxUserSetupV2 script permissions (sudo chmod -X)
I believe that is all the nuanced details needed to know for this script if you come accross any bugs/finding/comments/or words of kindness, be sure to reach out.

Enjoy!!!
